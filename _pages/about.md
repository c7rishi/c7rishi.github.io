Hello, welcome to my homepage!  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. I received my PhD in statistics from the University of Florida in 2018. Prior to joining UF, I went to Presidency College, Kolkata, for a B.Sc. (Hons) degree in statistics, and to the Indian Statistical Institute for an M.S. in statistics (with a specialization of Applied Statistics and Data Analysis).
