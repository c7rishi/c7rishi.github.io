Hello, and welcome to my homepage!  I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the School of Public Health and Health Professions, State University of New York at Buffalo. I currently serve as the [IBS](https://www.biometricsociety.org/home) [Biometric Bulletin](https://www.biometricsociety.org/publications/biometric-bulletin) Correspondent for the Eastern North American Region ([ENAR](https://www.enar.org/index.cfm)). 

I received my PhD in statistics from the University of Florida in 2018, and then did two years of postdoctoral research in statistical genomics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. Prior to joining University of Florida, I went to Presidency College, Kolkata, India, for a B.Sc. (Hons) degree in statistics, and then to the Indian Statistical Institute for an M.S. in statistics with a specialization in Applied Statistics and Data Analysis.
