Hello, welcome to my homepage!  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. I received my PhD in statistics from the University of Florida in 2018. Prior to joining the UF, I went to the Presidency College, Kolkata, for my B.Sc. (Hons) degree in statistics, and to the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata for my M.S. degree in statistics (with a specialization of Applied Statistics and Data Analysis).  I find methodological development of computational statistical techniques, particularly Bayesian/semi-Bayesian techniques, to solve problems involving complex modern-day *big* and *high-dimensional* data, e.g., those arising in  cancer genomics, computational biology and statistical ecology, particularly interesting. My current research can be classified into five broad categories, namely, (a) statistical modeling in genomics and computational biology, (b) convergence assessments of MCMC algorithms, (c) Bayesian methodologies for dimension reduction in multivariate analysis, (d) development of computational statistical software,  and (e) statistical analyses in collaborative scientific studies. Please see Publications for a detailed list.
