My research interest includes methodological development of computational statistical techniques, particularly Bayesian/semi-Bayesian techniques, to solve problems involving complex modern-day *big* and *high-dimensional* data, e.g., those arising in  cancer genomics, computational biology and statistical ecology, particularly interesting. Alongside methodological development I am also very interested in theoretical assessment and software implementation of computational methods. My current research can be classified into five broad categories, namely, (a) statistical modeling in genomics and computational biology, (b) convergence assessments of MCMC algorithms, (c) Bayesian methodologies for dimension reduction in multivariate analysis, (d) development of computational statistical software,  and (e) statistical analyses in collaborative scientific studies.
